## Closing Remarks

I enjoyed building this project and I learnt a lot while at it. Such as

- React class components (I'd always procrastinated because I was saisfied with hooks)
- GraphQL & Apollo (I had some difficulty with getting this one to work with class components)
- JS deep cloning (by far the best thing I learnt)

JS deep cloning using the [structuredClone](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/structuredClone) method was my favorite thing to learn because prior to discovering it, I used the spread operator and struggled with bugs for a while in cart logic.

For what it's worth, I want to mention that I only made my repo private after I was done with my initial submission. I later noticed that my repo had been cloned by multiple people. This broke my heart as I really worked hard on my cart logic and especially my "quick shop" implementation (as I thought it was unique). I hope this doesn't affect my chances.

Thank you.
